[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application boilerplate based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development.

## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 7 and an npm version >= 4.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MrRinsvind/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```
**Note**: If you can't use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), run `npm install`.

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ npm run start-renderer-dev
$ npm run start-main-dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:
```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true npm run package
```

## How to add modules to the project

You will need to add other modules to this boilerplate, depending on the requirements of your project. For example, you may want to add [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) to communicate with PostgreSQL database, or 
[material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) to reuse react UI components.

⚠️ Please read the following section before installing any dependencies ⚠️

### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure). This means, you will have two `package.json` files.

1. `./package.json` in the root of your project
1. `./app/package.json` inside `app` folder

### Which `package.json` file to use

**Rule of thumb** is: all modules go into `./package.json` except native modules. Native modules go into `./app/package.json`.

1. If the module is native to a platform (like node-postgres), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json`
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`.   See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md). Examples of such modules are `material-ui`, `redux-form`, and `moment`.
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.
